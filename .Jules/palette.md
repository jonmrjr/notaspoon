**Learning:** The application uses raw DOM manipulation in `app.js` to create the UI, which makes state management and accessibility updates a bit manual.
**Action:** When adding accessibility features, I need to ensure I update the DOM elements directly in the event listeners or update loops.

**Action:** Always consider alternative input methods (keyboard, gamepad) when designing game interactions, even for simple web games.
