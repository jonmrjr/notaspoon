## WebGL Environmental Notes

This application uses WebGL for 3D rendering. While the JavaScript and shader code is standard, WebGL's successful execution can be sensitive to the environment it runs in:

- **GPU Access:** Direct GPU access is generally required for hardware-accelerated WebGL. Some virtualized or sandboxed environments (including certain automated testing setups or headless browsers) may have limited or no direct GPU access.
- **Software Fallback:** While some browsers offer a software rendering fallback (like SwiftShader), this may also face limitations or require specific browser flags (e.g., `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader` in Chromium-based browsers).
- **`CreateCommandBuffer` Errors:** If you encounter errors like `Failed to send GpuControl.CreateCommandBuffer` or similar low-level graphics initialization errors in the browser console, it likely indicates an issue with the WebGL setup in that specific environment, rather than an error in the application's JavaScript code itself. The application logic may run correctly (as indicated by console logs), but no visuals will be produced.

If the spoon and grid do not render but you see console logs from `app.js` (especially the 'Success condition met' message), it's likely due to such an environmental constraint. The `glMatrix` library has been embedded in `index.html` to improve reliability across environments where fetching from CDNs might be restricted.
