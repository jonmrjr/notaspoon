# Notaspoon Repository Description

## Overview

**Notaspoon** is an interactive 3D WebGL game/application featuring a whimsical chase scenario between a metallic spoon and a purple monster. The project demonstrates advanced web graphics programming using Three.js and modern WebGL techniques.

## Project Details

- **Name**: notaspoon
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **License**: MIT License (Copyright 2025 Jonathan S. Rouach)
- **Type**: ES6 Module-based web application
- **Technology Stack**: Three.js, WebGL, JavaScript ES6+

## Core Functionality

### Game Mechanics
The application centers around an interactive chase game where:
- A **3D metallic spoon** moves around a reflective ground plane
- A **purple monster** (loaded from a GLTF 3D model) chases the spoon
- Players can click "Help Spoon!" to make the spoon perform evasive maneuvers
- Scoring system with combo multipliers for well-timed dodges
- Real-time particle effects and visual feedback

### Technical Features

#### 3D Graphics & Rendering
- **WebGL rendering** with Three.js framework
- **Post-processing effects** including bloom/glow effects using EffectComposer
- **Advanced lighting system** with dynamic spotlights and ambient lighting
- **Shadow mapping** with high-quality soft shadows (2048x2048 resolution)
- **Tone mapping** using ACES Filmic tone mapping for cinematic visuals
- **Reflective materials** with metalness and roughness properties

#### Visual Effects
- **Particle system** with 200+ animated particles in spiral galaxy formation
- **Dynamic particle colors** that shift through rainbow hues over time
- **Sparkle effects** when spoon successfully dodges
- **Success flash** visual feedback
- **Floating score** animations
- **Combo multiplier** effects

#### User Interface
- **Modern glassmorphism UI** with blur effects and gradient borders
- **Animated UI elements** with glowing borders and shimmer effects
- **Responsive design** that adapts to mobile devices
- **Real-time score and combo tracking**
- **Interactive game controls**

#### Camera & Controls
- **Orbit controls** for 3D scene navigation
- **Auto-rotation** when not in active gameplay
- **Smooth camera interpolation** and damping
- **Configurable zoom** and polar angle limits

## Technical Architecture

### Class Structure
The main application is built around the `AmazingApp` class with modular methods:
- `createScene()` - Scene setup with gradient background and fog
- `createRenderer()` - WebGL renderer configuration
- `createLighting()` - Dynamic lighting system
- `createPostProcessing()` - Visual effects pipeline
- `loadModels()` - Asynchronous 3D model loading
- `createParticleSystem()` - Particle effects generation
- `updateGameLogic()` - Game state management at 60 FPS

### Game State Management
- Score tracking with combo multipliers
- Chase mode activation/deactivation
- Collision detection for dodge mechanics
- Smooth character movement using lerp interpolation
- Boundary constraints to keep characters in play area

## Deployment

The application is configured for **GitHub Pages** deployment with:
- Custom domain support via CNAME file
- Static file serving requirements
- Local development server instructions (Python HTTP server)

## WebGL Compatibility Notes

The README includes important notes about WebGL environmental requirements:
- GPU access requirements for hardware acceleration
- Potential issues in virtualized environments
- Software fallback limitations
- Troubleshooting for `CreateCommandBuffer` errors
